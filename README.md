# AstroSlides
This repo is used for testing different Astro create configurations in different directories
for details see :
https://docs.astro.build/en/install/auto/

In addition, the custom part is to integrate Slides SVG Pan Zoom from https://github.com/WebSVG/next-svg

# Creation

    pnpm create astro@latest

if pnpm is not installed yet, it's possible to use npm or install pnpm with

    npm install -g pnpm@next-7

steps that can be done manually instead of using create command
* `pnpm install`
* `pnpx astro@latest add`

# Run

    pnpm run start
    pnpm run build
